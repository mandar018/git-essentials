git is a software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collabaratively developingh source code during software development.

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.


Git was originally authored by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development.[11] Since 2005, Junio Hamano has been the core maintainer. As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most clientâ€“server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server.[12] Git is free and open-source software distributed under the GPL-2.0-only license.
